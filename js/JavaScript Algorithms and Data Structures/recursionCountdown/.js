/*
We have defined a function called countdown with one parameter (n). 
The function should use recursion to return an array containing the integers n through 1 based on the n parameter.
 If the function is called with a number less than 1, the function should return an empty array. 
 For example, calling this function with n = 5 should return the array [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]. 
 Your function must use recursion by calling itself and must not use loops of any kind.
*/
function countdown(n){
    if(n<1) return [];
    const countArray = countdown(n - 1);
    countArray.unshift(n);
    return countArray;
  }
  
  console.log(countdown(5));

  /*
countdown(-1) should return an empty array.
countdown(10) should return [10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
countdown(5) should return [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
Your code should not rely on any kind of loops (for, while or higher order functions such as forEach, map, filter, and reduce).
You should use recursion to solve this problem.
